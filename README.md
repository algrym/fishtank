# fishtank :tropical_fish:
A fish tank in your ~~console~~ GUI, written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). :crab:

(It isn't really a console application anymore, but now it uses [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) ... which is _awesome._)

## To see the fishes:

* First set up a [Rust build environment](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).

* Then download, build, and run as follows:
```
git checkout https://github.com/algrym/fishtank
cd fishtank
cargo run --release
```
The build takes about 6.5 minutes, according to Dependabot.

Thanks to [Kenney.nl](https://kenney.nl/) for the fish art.
